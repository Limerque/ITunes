## Security Measures

This app has implemented the following security measures:

1. **Helmet Middleware**: The app uses the `helmet` middleware to add security headers to the HTTP response, helping to protect against various attacks.

2. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information, such as API keys, are stored as environment variables and not hard-coded in the codebase. This ensures that the keys are not exposed in the source code repository.

3. **API Key Handling**: The app communicates with the iTunes Search API, which requires an API key. The API key is securely stored as an environment variable on the server-side. The frontend app sends the search requests to the server, which then communicates with the API using the stored API key. This approach ensures that the API key is not exposed to the client-side code.
